        After finishing homework, children like to enjoy their free time by doing some extra-curricular activities. Such as painting, dancing, singing, or playing. It relaxes their minds and prepares them for another day of hard work. Hobbies can be pursued as a leisure activity. This also helps help us to make more friends who live in our area of interest. A hobby can be of any type, easy or difficult. Stamp collection is a very difficult type of hobby as it requires a lot of patience. Whereas painting and dancing can be done at any time.
